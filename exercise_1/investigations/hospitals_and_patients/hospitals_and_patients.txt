The Question:
-------------
Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated
with patient survey responses?

My Understanding:
------------------
In this case we want to look for a correlation between:
1) the mean hospital score and the survey response score
2) the "procedural variability" (must be per-hospital as the survey responses
are per-hospital) and the survey response score

To do this we need two queries that use the builtin corr (correlation)
function.

The results:
1) Correlation is 0.06167511813721054, which is close to zero so no
correlation
2) Correlation is -0.1285581252578065, which by statistical stadards is no
correlation (inside -0.5 and +0.5)
