The Question:
-------------
Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

The Understanding:
------------------
From this question I understand the following: We are being asked to find 
which procedures have the greatest variablility.  Since the procedures 
happen at hospitals and there is at most one score for each procedure
per-hospital, between hospitals is implied.
We are looking in this case for the largest range of values for particular
procedures across the whole sets of scores.
The query in this case is to calculate the difference between the maximum and
minimum values for a procedure (independent of hospitals) and find the top 10
with the biggest range

The results are :
Here the range column is the difference between the maximum and the minimum
and is the variability in the procedure.

Range	Maximum	Minimum	procedure	Procedure description
100.0   100.0   0.0     STK_8   Stroke Education
100.0   100.0   0.0     VTE_1   Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis
100.0   100.0   0.0     VTE_2   Intensive Care Unit Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis
100.0   100.0   0.0     IMM_2   Influenza Immunization
100.0   100.0   0.0     HF_2    Evaluation of LVS Function
100.0   100.0   0.0     OP_23   Head CT Scan Results for Acute Ischemic Stroke or Hemorrhagic Stroke Patients who Received Head CT or MRI Scan Interpretation Within 45 Minutes of ED Arrival
100.0   100.0   0.0     PC_01   Elective Delivery
100.0   100.0   0.0     VTE_4   Venous Thromboembolism Patients Receiving Unfractionated Heparin with Dosages/Platelet Count Monitoring by Protocol or Nomogram
100.0   100.0   0.0     STK_5   Antithrombotic Therapy By End of Hospital Day 2
100.0   100.0   0.0     SCIP_VTE_2      Surgery Patients Who Received Appropriate Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis Within 24 Hours Prior to Surgery to 24 Hours After Surgery

However these results are suspicious.  A maximum value of 100 in some
hospitals and 0 in others raises the following questions:
1) Are the zero values correct?  Are there really some hospitals that scored
0 or did someone fill in 0 thinking that this was a "Not Available" type
answer?
2) Have I made a mistake?  I have done some checking, particularly of the
footnote field in the "Timely and Effective care.csv" to see if I can recognize
when a score should be ignored.  I did not find anything conclusive and so
rather than getting stuck in analysis paralysis I have decided to accept the
results.

As a consequence the list above is not sufficient.  All entries have the 
range 100 so we cannot really give the top 10 since there are several others 
(5 more) that also have a range of 100.  These are now provided here and the
query updated to select where the range is 100.
