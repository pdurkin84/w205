The Question:
-------------
Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated
with patient survey responses?

My Understanding:
------------------
In this case we want to look for a correlation between:
1) the hospital quality and the survey score.  I chose the columns/fields
	- the hospital mean score as the best single value that represents the 
		hospitals quality,
	- the patientexperienceofcaredomain field from the survey table.  This
		was discussed in the README.pdf as a good overall score from the 
		patient survey
2) the "procedural variability" agains the patient survey.  Since the patient
	survey is per-hospital we must be required to look for procedural variability
	within the hospitals (rather than variability for the same procedure between
	hospitals) and so I chose the range in the HospitalScores table.  This is
	correlated against the patientexperienceofcaredomain from the survey table.

To do this we need two queries that use the builtin corr (correlation)
function.

The results:
1) Correlation is 0.06167511813721054, which is close to zero so no
correlation
2) Correlation is -0.1285581252578065, which by statistical stadards is no
correlation (inside -0.5 and +0.5)
